11 Error for errstr Process count (num1) is NOT EQUAL (num 2).... (where num1 < num2)
eg
Results for search text =3D (recorddispatcher)
  Exception : (NA)
  Owner   :  (nikira)   Optional Flag: (N)   Ignore Child: (N)
  Criteria:  (=3D5)   Enabled Flag (TRUE)   Server Name (nikirapp)
  PID Files: (NA)
  State for violations: (ERROR)
MONM-000011: Process count (6) is NOT EQUAL to expected process count of (=
=3D 5)!

for above do not hard code Process count (0) but implement logic that whatever num1 is it has to be less than num2 .
In this case 6 > 5 so it is not an error but if 6 and 5 were to be interchanged it wud be an error

12. Configuration should be added to ignore a particular process name being down even if the errstr points to it being down (eg for above process name is recorddispatcher '
and there should be some mechanism which can ignore this process name as error if need be)

13 Like time also include for ignoreprocessname=true/false

*** Generalised VBM-NMS features ***

14.errstr should respond to contains(errstr) and not equals(errstr)

15.Remove all occurances of the word error
